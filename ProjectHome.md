IGMtransmission is a Java graphical user interface that implements Monte Carlo simulations to compute the corrections to colours of high-redshift galaxies due to intergalactic attenuation based on current models of the Intergalactic Medium. The effects of absorption due to neutral hydrogen are considered, with particular attention to the stochastic effects of Lyman Limit Systems.

The effect of the attenuation on the colours of galaxies is computed for a wide sample of filters and simulated galaxy spectra. Alternatively, the code allows the user to upload their own filter response curves and spectra.
